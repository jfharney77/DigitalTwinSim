          The sequence is a fixed trace computed by the backend; Run only
          plays it back. The migration step dwells longest, and honestly so —
          moving workloads between virtualization platforms is real work.
          The claim is not that switching is quick. It is that switching is
          possible without an outage, and that in a coupled architecture the
          alternative to a slow migration is a new estate.
